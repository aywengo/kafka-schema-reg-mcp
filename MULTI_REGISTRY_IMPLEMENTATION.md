## üåü **Real-World Usage Examples**

### **üöÄ Environment Promotion Workflow**
```
Human: "Compare our staging and production registries to see what needs to be promoted"

Claude: I'll compare your staging and production registries.

[Uses compare_registries MCP tool]

üìä Comparison Results (staging vs production):
‚Ä¢ Schemas only in staging: 3
  - user-preferences-v2 (new feature)
  - payment-methods-v3 (bug fix)
  - notification-events-v1 (new service)
‚Ä¢ Schemas only in production: 0
‚Ä¢ Common schemas: 15

Would you like me to migrate these 3 new schemas to production?
```

### **üîÑ Disaster Recovery Synchronization**
```
Human: "Set up automatic synchronization between our primary production registry and disaster recovery site"

Claude: I'll configure bidirectional synchronization for disaster recovery.

[Uses schedule_sync MCP tool]

‚úÖ Sync job created: sync-prod-dr-001
‚Ä¢ Source: production registry
‚Ä¢ Target: disaster-recovery registry  
‚Ä¢ Direction: bidirectional
‚Ä¢ Interval: Every 30 minutes
‚Ä¢ Scope: All contexts and schemas

Your DR site will now stay in sync automatically.
```

### **üè¢ Multi-Tenant Schema Management**
```
Human: "Compare the ACME client context between our dev and production registries, then migrate any missing schemas"

Claude: I'll check the ACME client schemas and migrate what's needed.

[Uses compare_contexts_across_registries MCP tool, then migrate_context]

üìä ACME Context Comparison:
‚Ä¢ Dev-only schemas: 2 (acme-orders-v3, acme-preferences-v1)
‚Ä¢ Production-only: 0
‚Ä¢ Common schemas: 8

‚úÖ Migration completed: acme-orders-v3, acme-preferences-v1
Your ACME client schemas are now synchronized.
```

### **üîß Legacy System Migration**
```
Human: "I need to migrate our entire legacy Schema Registry to the new Confluent Cloud instance. Show me what would be affected first."

Claude: I'll analyze the migration scope for you.

[Uses generate_migration_report MCP tool]

üìã Migration Report (legacy ‚Üí confluent-cloud):
‚Ä¢ Total schemas: 47
‚Ä¢ Total contexts: 6
‚Ä¢ Estimated migration time: 15 minutes
‚Ä¢ Compatibility conflicts: 0
‚Ä¢ Data size: 2.3 MB

The migration looks clean with no conflicts. Would you like me to proceed with the actual migration?
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Single registry (backward compatibility)
export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL="http://localhost:8081"
export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_USER="admin"
export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="password"

# Multi-registry configuration
export REGISTRIES_CONFIG='{
  "dev": {
    "url": "http://dev-schema-registry:8081",
    "user": "dev-user",
    "password": "dev-pass",
    "description": "Development environment"
  },

# Safety features
export READONLY="false"  # Set to "true" for production safety
```

### **Claude Desktop Configuration**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kafka-schema-registry-multi": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["kafka_schema_registry_multi_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "REGISTRIES_CONFIG": "{\"dev\":{\"url\":\"http://localhost:8081\",\"user\":\"\",\"password\":\"\",\"description\":\"Development environment\"},\"staging\":{\"url\":\"http://localhost:8082\",\"user\":\"\",\"password\":\"\",\"description\":\"Staging environment\"},\"production\":{\"url\":\"http://localhost:8083\",\"user\":\"\",\"password\":\"\",\"description\":\"Production environment\"}}",
        "READONLY": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí **Production Safety Features**

### **READONLY Mode (Multi-Registry)**
When `READONLY=true`, all modification operations are blocked across **ALL registries**:

**üö´ Blocked Operations:**
- Schema registration and deletion (all registries)
- Context creation and deletion (all registries) 
- Configuration changes (all registries)
- Migration operations (unless dry_run=true)
- Synchronization operations

**‚úÖ Allowed Operations:**
- All read operations (all registries)
- Cross-registry comparisons
- Migration previews (dry_run=true)
- Export operations
- Connection testing

### **Migration Safety**
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview all changes before execution
- **Rollback Capability**: Undo migrations if needed
- **Migration History**: Track all operations with timestamps
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify compatibility issues before migration

---

## üéØ **Enterprise Use Cases**

- **Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production** schema promotion
- **Feature branch** schema testing with temporary registries
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed deployments

### **2. Multi-Environment Operations**

- **Configuration drift detection** across environments
- **Compliance reporting** across all registries

### **3. Disaster Recovery**

## üéâ **Summary**

The Multi-Registry MCP Server transforms schema management from a single-registry operation to a **comprehensive enterprise solution** with:

- **48 Total Tools** (20 enhanced + 28 new)
- **Natural Language Interface** via Claude Desktop
- **Cross-Registry Operations** for comparison and migration
- **Production Safety** with READONLY mode and dry-run capabilities
- **Enterprise Workflows** for environment promotion and disaster recovery
- **Backward Compatibility** with all existing functionality

This implementation makes complex multi-registry operations as simple as natural language conversations with Claude Desktop! üöÄ
