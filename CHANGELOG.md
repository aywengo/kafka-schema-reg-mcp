## [1.4.0] - 2024-12-XX

### üöÄ Major Features: Async Operations & Progress Tracking

This release introduces a comprehensive async task management system with real-time progress tracking for long-running operations, making the MCP server more responsive and providing better visibility into operation status.

### Added

#### Async Task Management System
- **Task Queue Architecture**: Background execution for long-running operations (migration, cleanup, comparison)
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor operation progress with percentage completion and status updates
- **Task Lifecycle Management**: Create, execute, monitor, and cancel tasks
- **Operation Classification**: Operations categorized as QUICK (<5s), MEDIUM (5-30s), or LONG (>30s)
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of running tasks on exit

#### New Progress Monitoring Tools
- `get_task_progress(task_id)`: Get detailed progress for any task
- `get_migration_progress(task_id)`: Migration-specific progress monitoring
- `get_cleanup_progress(task_id)`: Cleanup operation progress
- `get_comparison_progress(task_id)`: Comparison operation progress
- `list_all_active_tasks()`: View all running/pending tasks
- `list_migration_tasks()`: List migration-specific tasks
- `list_cleanup_tasks()`: List cleanup-specific tasks
- `list_comparison_tasks()`: List comparison tasks
- `watch_comparison_progress()`: Guidance for real-time monitoring

#### Enhanced Async Operations
- **Migration Operations**: `migrate_schema`, `migrate_context` now return task IDs immediately
- **Cleanup Operations**: `clear_context_batch`, `clear_multiple_contexts_batch` use task queue
- **Comparison Operations**: `compare_contexts_across_registries`, `compare_different_contexts` run async
- **Progress Stages**: Human-readable progress descriptions for each operation phase

### Improved

#### Error Handling
- Better handling of missing event loops (fallback to threading)
- Graceful task cancellation during shutdown
- Comprehensive error reporting in task results

#### Performance
- Non-blocking execution for long operations
- Parallel task execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Progress-based time estimation for running tasks

#### MCP Client Experience
- Operations return immediately with task IDs
- Clients can poll for progress without timeout issues
- Clear operation metadata (duration, pattern) via `get_operation_info_tool()`

### Fixed
- Event loop closed errors during shutdown
- Task cleanup issues with interrupted operations
- Async operation handling without active event loops
- Test failures related to async task patterns

### Technical Details

#### Task States
- **PENDING**: Task created but not started
- **RUNNING**: Task actively executing
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Task encountered an error
- **CANCELLED**: Task was cancelled

#### Progress Tracking
- 0-100% completion tracking
- Operation-specific progress stages
- Duration tracking and time estimation
- Detailed result storage

### Migration Guide

For MCP clients using long-running operations:

**Before (v1.3.x):**
```python
# Operation blocks until complete
result = migrate_context(source="dev", target="prod", context="production")
# Client might timeout on long operations
```

**After (v1.4.0):**
```python
# Operation returns immediately with task info
task_info = migrate_context(source="dev", target="prod", context="production")
task_id = task_info["task_id"]

# Poll for progress
while True:
    progress = get_task_progress(task_id)
    print(f"Status: {progress['status']}, Progress: {progress['progress_percent']}%")
    if progress['status'] in ['completed', 'failed', 'cancelled']:
        break
    time.sleep(2)
```
