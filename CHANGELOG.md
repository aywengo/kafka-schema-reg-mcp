## [1.8.2] - Unreleased

### üöÄ Simplified Context Migration with External Tool Integration

#### Changed
- **`migrate_context` Simplified**: Now generates ready-to-run Docker commands instead of configuration files
  - Returns single Docker command with all necessary environment variables
  - Simplified workflow: copy command ‚Üí run ‚Üí monitor output
  - Leverages [kafka-schema-reg-migrator](https://github.com/aywengo/kafka-schema-reg-migrator) for robust context migrations
  - Automatic registry credential mapping and context handling
  - Clear separation: MCP handles single schema operations, external tool handles context migrations
  - Updated tests to match new simplified behavior

#### Improved
- **Migration Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between MCP and external migration tool
- **User Experience**: Streamlined from multi-file configuration to single command execution
- **Documentation**: Updated all references to reflect new migrate_context behavior

## [1.8.2] - 2025-06-07

### üîí Security, OAuth, and Documentation Consistency Release

#### Changed
- **Enforced tool-level OAuth scope requirements**: All MCP tools now have explicit `@require_scopes` decorators (`read`, `write`, or `admin`) matching their intended permissions.
- **README updated**: Tool-to-scope mapping in the documentation now matches the code exactly. Security and OAuth documentation clarified.
- **Internal consistency**: All `@mcp.tool()` functions are now consistently protected by the correct scope decorators.
- **No breaking changes**: All tool signatures and APIs remain backward compatible.
- **Minor documentation improvements**: Clarified how to audit tool permissions using `get_oauth_scopes_info`.
- **No configuration or deployment changes**: All environment variables and Docker usage remain the same.

## [1.8.1] - 2025-06-06

### üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture Refactoring

This release introduces a comprehensive modular architecture that transforms the monolithic codebase into 8 specialized modules, significantly improving maintainability, development efficiency, and code organization.

### Added
- **Modular Architecture**: Split 3917-line monolithic file into 8 focused modules
  - `task_management.py` (280 lines): Async task queue operations for long-running processes
  - `migration_tools.py` (400+ lines): Schema and context migration between registries
  - `comparison_tools.py` (160 lines): Registry and context comparison operations
  - `export_tools.py` (200 lines): Schema export in multiple formats (JSON, Avro IDL)
  - `batch_operations.py` (350+ lines): Batch cleanup operations with progress tracking
  - `statistics_tools.py` (150 lines): Counting and statistics operations
  - `core_registry_tools.py` (600+ lines): Basic CRUD operations for schemas, subjects, configs
  - `kafka_schema_registry_unified_modular.py` (500 lines): Main orchestration server file

### Improved

#### Development & Maintainability

- Async operation handling without active event loops
- Test failures related to async task patterns

### Technical Details

#### Task States
- **PENDING**: Task created but not started
- **RUNNING**: Task actively executing
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Task encountered an error
- **CANCELLED**: Task was cancelled

#### Progress Tracking
- 0-100% completion tracking
- Operation-specific progress stages
- Duration tracking and time estimation
- Detailed result storage

### Migration Guide

For MCP clients using long-running operations:

**Before (v1.3.x):**
```python
# Operation blocks until complete
result = migrate_context(source="dev", target="prod", context="production")
# Client might timeout on long operations
```

**After (v1.4.0):**
```python
# Operation returns immediately with task info
task_info = migrate_context(source="dev", target="prod", context="production")
task_id = task_info["task_id"]

# Poll for progress
while True:
    progress = get_task_progress(task_id)
    print(f"Status: {progress['status']}, Progress: {progress['progress_percent']}%")
    if progress['status'] in ['completed', 'failed', 'cancelled']:
        break
    time.sleep(2)
```
