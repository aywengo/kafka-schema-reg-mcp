## Quick Registration

### 🎯 Copy & Paste Templates

**Basic User Schema:**
```
"Register a user schema with:
- id (long, required)
- name (string, required)
- email (string, optional)
- created_at (timestamp-millis)"
```

**Order Schema:**
```
"Register an order schema with:

```
"Register an event schema with:
- event_id (string)
- event_type (string)
- timestamp (long)
- payload (map of strings)"
```

## 🏗️ Advanced Registration

### With Context
```
"Register user schema in production context"
"Register order schema in development registry"
```

### With Namespace
```
"Register com.company.User schema with id and name fields"
```

### Complete Example
```
"Register a Product schema with:
- namespace: com.example.inventory
- fields:
  - sku (string, required)
  - name (string, required)
  - description (string, optional with default '')
  - price (decimal with precision 10,2)
  - in_stock (boolean, default true)
  - categories (array of strings)
in the production context"
```

## ⚡ Schema Types

| Type | When to Use | Example Field |
|------|------------|--------------|
| AVRO (default) | Most cases, supports evolution | All examples above |
| JSON | Simple validation, web APIs | `"Register JSON schema for REST endpoint"` |
| PROTOBUF | gRPC services, binary efficiency | `"Register protobuf User message"` |

## ✅ Validation Features
- Automatic syntax validation
- Compatibility checking
- Duplicate detection
- Field type validation

## 🚨 Common Errors & Solutions

**"Invalid schema"** → Check JSON syntax, missing commas
**"Incompatible schema"** → Add fields as optional with defaults
**"Subject not found"** → Create subject first or check context

**Next step?** Try registering a simple test schema!"""

## Quick Context Commands

### 🚀 Essential Operations
```
"List all contexts"
"Create production context"
"Show schemas in development context"
"Delete empty test-context"
```

## 🎯 Context Strategies

### 1. Environment-Based (Recommended)
```
development/   → Active development

### 3. Compliance-Based
```
gdpr/      → GDPR-compliant schemas
pci/       → Payment schemas
public/    → External API schemas
```
**Example**: `"Create gdpr context with description 'GDPR-compliant schemas only'"`

## 📋 Context Operations

| Operation | Command Example |
|-----------|----------------|
| List schemas | `"Show all schemas in production"` |
| Count schemas | `"How many schemas in development?"` |
| Register in context | `"Register user schema in staging context"` |

def get_schema_compatibility_prompt():
    """Guide for schema compatibility and evolution"""
    return """# Schema Compatibility Guide 🔄

## Quick Compatibility Checks

### 🎯 Common Checks
```
"Is adding email field to user schema safe?"
"Check compatibility before adding age field"
"Can I remove the legacy_field safely?"
"What's the compatibility setting for user schema?"
```

## ✅ Safe Changes (Backward Compatible)

### Always Safe:
- ✅ Add optional field with default
- ✅ Add new enum value
- ✅ Widen types (int → long)
- ✅ Add aliases

### Examples:
```
"Add optional phone field with default empty string"
"Add CANCELLED to order status enum"
"Change user_id from int to long"
```

## ❌ Breaking Changes

### Never Safe Without Coordination:
- ❌ Rename fields
- ❌ Change types incompatibly
- ❌ Remove required fields
- ❌ Change namespace

### Examples That Break:
```
"Rename username to user_name"  ❌
"Change ID from long to string" ❌
"Remove required email field"   ❌
```

## 📊 Compatibility Levels

| Level | What It Means | Use When |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **BACKWARD** | New schema reads old data | Default, most common |
| **FORWARD** | Old schema reads new data | Careful planning needed |
| **FULL** | Both ways compatible | Maximum safety |
| **NONE** | No checking | Development only |

### Setting Compatibility:
```
"Set user schema to BACKWARD compatibility"
"Set global compatibility to FULL"
"Use NONE compatibility in development context"
```

## 🔄 Evolution Patterns

### Adding a Field Safely:
```
1. "Check current user schema"
2. "Add optional 'preferences' field with default {}"
3. "Check compatibility"
4. "Register if compatible"
```

### Deprecating a Field:
```
1. "Mark field as deprecated in documentation"
2. "Stop writing to field"
3. "Wait for consumers to update"
4. "Remove field in major version"
```

### Type Migration:
```
1. "Add new field with new type"
2. "Write to both fields"
3. "Migrate readers to new field"
4. "Remove old field later"
```

## 🚨 Compatibility Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Field removed" | Add back as optional |
| "Type changed" | Use union types or aliases |
| "Required field added" | Make optional with default |
| "Namespace changed" | Add alias for old namespace |

## 💡 Best Practices
- Always check before registering
- Use optional fields for new additions
- Plan breaking changes carefully
- Test in development first

**Try**: `"Check if adding age field to user schema is safe"`"""

## 📋 Common Evolution Scenarios

### Adding Fields Safely
```
"Add optional phone field to user schema"
→ Assistant guides: field type, default value, compatibility check

"Add required email field to existing schema"
→ Assistant plans: migration strategy, consumer updates, rollback plan
```

### Removing Fields
```
"Remove deprecated legacy_id field"
→ Assistant checks: consumer usage, deprecation timeline, safe removal

"Clean up unused fields from order schema"
→ Assistant validates: no active readers, safe to remove
```

### Type Changes
```
"Change user_id from string to long"
→ Assistant plans: dual-field approach, consumer migration, cleanup

"Convert price from float to decimal"
→ Assistant suggests: precision handling, data migration strategy
```

### Complex Restructuring
```
"Split address field into street, city, zip"
→ Assistant designs: multi-phase migration, intermediate schemas

"Merge user and profile schemas"
→ Assistant coordinates: cross-schema migration, consumer updates
```

## 🔄 Evolution Strategies Explained

### 🎯 Direct Update
**Best for**: Non-breaking changes, coordinated deployments
**Process**: Update schema directly
**Example**: Adding optional fields with defaults

### 🔄 Multi-Version Migration  
**Best for**: Breaking changes with many consumers
**Process**: Create intermediate schema versions for gradual migration
**Timeline**: Usually 2-4 weeks depending on consumer count

### 🔀 Dual Support
**Best for**: Supporting old and new formats simultaneously
**Process**: Implement logic to handle both schemas
**Use case**: Long-term backward compatibility needs

### 📈 Blue-Green Deployment
**Best for**: Critical systems requiring zero downtime
**Process**: Parallel environments with atomic switchover
**Complexity**: High, but maximum safety

## 💡 Best Practices Built-In
