## üí° Natural Language Interaction Tips

### **Effective Commands:**
- **Be Specific**: "Register a user schema in production context" vs "Create schema"
- **Include Context**: "Show staging schemas" vs "Show schemas"  
- **Specify Format**: "Export as Avro IDL" vs "Export schema"
- **Ask for Help**: "What compatibility levels are available?"

### **Complex Workflows:**
- **Multi-Step Operations**: "Check compatibility, then register if safe"
- **Conditional Logic**: "Register in staging only if compatible with production"
- **Bulk Operations**: "Export all schemas from development context"

### **Best Practices:**
- ‚úÖ Use clear, descriptive schema and context names
- ‚úÖ Always check compatibility before production changes
- ‚úÖ Export schemas before major changes for backup
- ‚úÖ Clean up temporary contexts after feature completion
- ‚úÖ Use context isolation for different environments

---

## üîí VIEWONLY Mode (Production Safety)

The MCP server includes a **production safety feature** that can be enabled by setting the `VIEWONLY=true` environment variable. When enabled, all modification operations are blocked while read and export operations remain fully functional.

### **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Enable VIEWONLY mode for production safety
export VIEWONLY=true

# Or in Docker/Claude Desktop
"env": {
  "VIEWONLY": "true",
  "SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL": "http://localhost:8081"
}
```

### **Blocked Operations in VIEWONLY Mode**
When VIEWONLY mode is enabled, the following tools will return an error:
- üö´ `register_schema` - Cannot register new schemas
- üö´ `create_context` / `delete_context` - Cannot modify contexts
- üö´ `delete_subject` - Cannot delete subjects
- üö´ `update_global_config` / `update_subject_config` - Cannot modify configuration
- üö´ `update_mode` / `update_subject_mode` - Cannot change operational modes

### **Allowed Operations in VIEWONLY Mode**
These tools continue to work normally:
- ‚úÖ All `get_*` tools - Read schema information and configuration
- ‚úÖ All `list_*` tools - Browse available schemas and contexts
- ‚úÖ `check_compatibility` - Test schema compatibility (no modifications)
- ‚úÖ All `export_*` tools - Generate backups and documentation

### **Claude Desktop Usage in VIEWONLY Mode**
```
Human: "Register a new user schema with id and name fields"

Claude: I attempted to register the schema, but the operation was blocked because the MCP server is running in VIEWONLY mode for production safety. 

Error: Operation blocked: MCP server is running in VIEWONLY mode. Set VIEWONLY=false to enable modification operations.

However, I can help you with read-only operations like:
- Viewing existing schemas
- Checking compatibility
- Exporting schemas for documentation
- Browsing contexts and subjects

Would you like me to show you the current schemas instead?
```

### **Benefits**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production Safety**: Prevents accidental modifications to critical schemas
- üìä **Full Visibility**: Complete read access for monitoring and analysis
- üì§ **Backup Capability**: All export operations remain available
- üîç **Compatibility Testing**: Can still validate schema changes without applying them

**Note**: This tool generates a single Docker command with all necessary environment variables pre-configured. This provides a streamlined workflow for context migration using the specialized external tool.

**Parameters:**
- `context` (string): Context name to migrate
- `source_registry` (string): Source registry name
- `target_registry` (string): Target registry name
- `target_context` (string, optional): Target context name
- `dry_run` (boolean, optional): Generate command for preview mode (default: true)
- `preserve_ids` (boolean, optional): Preserve schema IDs (default: true)
- `migrate_all_versions` (boolean, optional): Migrate all versions (default: true)

**Returns**: Docker command with:
- Complete docker run command with all environment variables
- Automatic registry credential mapping
- Context configuration
- Instructions for execution
- Environment variables list for reference

## Schema Statistics and Counting Tools

The following tools provide comprehensive statistics and counting capabilities for Schema Registry instances.

### Count Contexts
```python
@mcp.tool()
def count_contexts(registry: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Count the number of contexts in a registry.
    
    Args:
        registry: Optional registry name. If not provided, uses default registry.
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - registry: Registry name
        - total_contexts: Total number of contexts
        - contexts: List of context names
        - timestamp: Current timestamp
    """
```

Example usage:
```python
# Count contexts in default registry
result = count_contexts()
print(f"Found {result['total_contexts']} contexts: {result['contexts']}")

# Count contexts in specific registry
result = count_contexts(registry="production")
print(f"Found {result['total_contexts']} contexts in production")
```

### Count Schemas
```python
@mcp.tool()
def count_schemas(
    context: Optional[str] = None,
    registry: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Count the number of schemas in a context or registry.
    
    Args:
        context: Optional context name. If not provided, counts all contexts.
        registry: Optional registry name. If not provided, uses default registry.

result = count_schemas()
print(f"Found {result['total_schemas']} schemas")

# Count schemas in specific context
result = count_schemas(context="production")
print(f"Found {result['total_schemas']} schemas in production context")

# Count schemas in specific registry and context
result = count_schemas(context="staging", registry="development")
print(f"Found {result['total_schemas']} schemas in staging context of development registry")
```

### Count Schema Versions
```python
@mcp.tool()
def count_schema_versions(
    subject: str,
    context: Optional[str] = None,
    registry: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Count the number of versions for a specific schema.
    
    Args:
        subject: Schema subject name
        context: Optional context name. If not provided, uses default context.
        registry: Optional registry name. If not provided, uses default registry.
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - registry: Registry name
        - context: Context name
        - subject: Schema subject name
        - total_versions: Total number of versions
        - versions: List of version numbers
        - timestamp: Current timestamp
    """
```

Example usage:
```python
# Count versions of a schema in default context
result = count_schema_versions(subject="user-value")
print(f"Found {result['total_versions']} versions of user-value schema")

# Count versions in specific context
result = count_schema_versions(subject="order-value", context="production")
print(f"Found {result['total_versions']} versions in production context")

# Count versions in specific registry and context
result = count_schema_versions(
    subject="payment-value",
    context="staging",
    registry="development"
)
print(f"Found {result['total_versions']} versions in staging context of development registry")
```

### Get Registry Statistics
```python
@mcp.tool()
def get_registry_statistics(
    registry: Optional[str] = None,
    include_context_details: bool = True
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get comprehensive statistics about a registry.
    
    Args:
        registry: Optional registry name. If not provided, uses default registry.
        include_context_details: Whether to include detailed context information.
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - registry: Registry name
        - total_contexts: Total number of contexts
        - total_schemas: Total number of schemas
        - total_versions: Total number of schema versions
        - avg_versions_per_schema: Average versions per schema
        - contexts: Optional detailed context information
        - timestamp: Current timestamp
    """
```

Example usage:
```python
# Get basic statistics
result = get_registry_statistics(include_context_details=False)
print(f"Registry has {result['total_contexts']} contexts")
print(f"Total schemas: {result['total_schemas']}")
print(f"Total versions: {result['total_versions']}")
print(f"Average versions per schema: {result['avg_versions_per_schema']:.2f}")

# Get detailed statistics with context information
result = get_registry_statistics(include_context_details=True)
for context in result['contexts']:
    print(f"\nContext: {context['name']}")
    print(f"Schemas: {context['total_schemas']}")
    print(f"Versions: {context['total_versions']}")
```

### Error Handling
All counting tools handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages:

```python
# Example error response
{
    "error": "Registry not found: production",
    "timestamp": "2024-03-14T12:34:56Z"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- Registry not found
- Context not found
- Schema subject not found
- Connection errors
- Authentication failures

### Best Practices
1. Use `get_registry_statistics` for comprehensive overview
2. Use specific counting tools for targeted information
3. Include context names for precise counting
4. Handle potential errors in responses
5. Use timestamps for tracking data freshness
