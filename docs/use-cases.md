## Schema Statistics and Monitoring

### Registry Health Monitoring
Monitor the health and growth of your Schema Registry instances:

```python
# Get comprehensive registry statistics
stats = get_registry_statistics(registry="production")
print(f"Production Registry Status:")
print(f"- Total Contexts: {stats['total_contexts']}")
print(f"- Total Schemas: {stats['total_schemas']}")
print(f"- Total Versions: {stats['total_versions']}")
print(f"- Avg Versions/Schema: {stats['avg_versions_per_schema']:.2f}")

# Monitor context growth
for context in stats['contexts']:
    print(f"\nContext: {context['name']}")
    print(f"- Schemas: {context['total_schemas']}")
    print(f"- Versions: {context['total_versions']}")
```

### Schema Evolution Tracking
Track schema evolution across different contexts:

```python
# Compare schema versions across contexts
dev_versions = count_schema_versions(
    subject="user-value",
    context="development"
)
prod_versions = count_schema_versions(
    subject="user-value",
    context="production"
)

print(f"Development: {dev_versions['total_versions']} versions")
print(f"Production: {prod_versions['total_versions']} versions")
print(f"Version difference: {abs(dev_versions['total_versions'] - prod_versions['total_versions'])}")
```

### Context Management
Monitor and manage contexts effectively:

```python
# Get context overview
contexts = count_contexts(registry="staging")
print(f"Staging Registry Contexts:")
for context in contexts['contexts']:
    schemas = count_schemas(context=context, registry="staging")
    print(f"\n{context}:")
    print(f"- Total Schemas: {schemas['total_schemas']}")
    print(f"- Schema List: {', '.join(schemas['schemas'])}")
```

### Migration Planning
Use statistics to plan and validate migrations:

```python
# Pre-migration analysis
source_stats = get_registry_statistics(registry="development")
target_stats = get_registry_statistics(registry="production")

print("Migration Planning:")
print(f"Source (Development):")
print(f"- Contexts: {source_stats['total_contexts']}")
print(f"- Schemas: {source_stats['total_schemas']}")
print(f"- Versions: {source_stats['total_versions']}")

print(f"\nTarget (Production):")
print(f"- Contexts: {target_stats['total_contexts']}")
print(f"- Schemas: {target_stats['total_schemas']}")
print(f"- Versions: {target_stats['total_versions']}")

# Calculate migration scope
contexts_to_migrate = set(source_stats['contexts']) - set(target_stats['contexts'])
print(f"\nContexts to migrate: {len(contexts_to_migrate)}")
```

### Schema Cleanup
Identify unused or outdated schemas:

```python
# Analyze schema versions
for context in get_registry_statistics()['contexts']:
    print(f"\nAnalyzing {context['name']}:")
    for schema in context['schemas']:
        versions = count_schema_versions(
            subject=schema,
            context=context['name']
        )
        if versions['total_versions'] > 5:
            print(f"⚠️  {schema}: {versions['total_versions']} versions")
            print(f"   Consider cleanup: {versions['versions']}")
```

### Multi-Registry Comparison
Compare statistics across multiple registries:

```python
# Compare registry statistics
registries = ["development", "staging", "production"]
for registry in registries:
    stats = get_registry_statistics(registry=registry)
    print(f"\n{registry.upper()} Registry:")
    print(f"- Contexts: {stats['total_contexts']}")
    print(f"- Schemas: {stats['total_schemas']}")
    print(f"- Versions: {stats['total_versions']}")
    print(f"- Avg Versions/Schema: {stats['avg_versions_per_schema']:.2f}")
```

### Best Practices
1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Schedule regular statistics collection
   - Track growth trends
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns

2. **Migration Planning**
   - Use statistics for migration scope
   - Validate target registry capacity
   - Track migration progress

3. **Cleanup Management**
   - Identify unused schemas
   - Track version history
   - Plan cleanup operations

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor schema distribution
   - Identify hot spots
   - Optimize context usage

5. **Security and Compliance**
   - Track schema changes
   - Monitor version history
   - Maintain audit trails
