# Security Scan Configuration

This document outlines the security scanning configuration for the Kafka Schema Registry MCP project.

## Overview

The project uses multiple security scanning tools to ensure the safety and security of the codebase and container images. As of the latest update, the security scans are configured to focus on **CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues only**, excluding MEDIUM and LOW severity findings from reports and automated actions.

## Severity Filtering Policy

### Included Severities
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Always reported, automatically creates issues, and can fail builds
- ðŸŸ  **HIGH**: Always reported and automatically creates issues for review

### Excluded Severities
- âšª **MEDIUM**: Excluded from automated reports and issue creation
- âšª **LOW**: Excluded from automated reports and issue creation

### Rationale
This filtering approach allows teams to focus on the most impactful security vulnerabilities while reducing noise from lower-severity issues that may not pose immediate threats in the specific deployment context.

## Security Scanning Workflows

### 1. Main Security Scan (`security-scan.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Scheduled runs on the 7th and 21st of each month at 2 AM UTC

**Components:**
- **Trivy Container Scan**: Vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Docker Security Best Practices**: Docker Bench Security scan
- **Dependency Security Check**: Python package vulnerability scanning with Safety and pip-audit
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog scan for leaked credentials

**Severity Configuration:**
- SARIF upload: `CRITICAL,HIGH`
- JSON processing: `CRITICAL,HIGH`
- Table format: `CRITICAL,HIGH`
- Build failure trigger: `CRITICAL` only

### 2. Docker Security Scan (`docker-security-scan.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Every Monday at 9 AM UTC (scheduled)
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Push to `main` with changes to `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, or the workflow file

**Components:**
- **Trivy Container Scan**: Focused vulnerability scanning
- **Automated Issue Creation**: Only for HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities

**Severity Configuration:**
- All scans: `CRITICAL,HIGH`
- Issue creation: Triggered only by CRITICAL or HIGH findings

## Automated Actions

### Issue Creation
- **Trigger**: CRITICAL vulnerabilities found during scheduled scans
- **Labels**: `security`, `vulnerability`, `critical`, `high-priority`
- **Content**: Detailed vulnerability information with remediation guidance

### Build Failures
- **Trigger**: CRITICAL vulnerabilities in pull requests and main branch builds
- **Behavior**: Workflow fails with exit code 1

### Notifications
- Security scan summaries are generated for each workflow run
- Results are uploaded to the GitHub Security tab (SARIF format)
- Artifacts are retained for 90 days for audit purposes

## Exception Handling

### Trivy Ignore File (`.trivyignore`)
Documented security exceptions are maintained in the `.trivyignore` file. Each exception includes:
- CVE number
- Clear justification for the exception
- Mitigation measures taken
- References to upstream decisions

### Current Exceptions
The project maintains exceptions for:
- System-level vulnerabilities not exploitable in containerized Python applications
- Base image vulnerabilities marked as `will_not_fix` by upstream maintainers
- Library vulnerabilities not relevant to the application's use case

## Security Reports

### GitHub Security Tab
- All CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings are uploaded in SARIF format
- Historical vulnerability data is maintained
- Integration with GitHub's security advisory database

### Artifacts
Each scan run produces downloadable artifacts containing:
- Trivy scan results (SARIF and JSON formats)
- Dependency scan reports
- Detailed vulnerability tables

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Review Security Issues**: Monitor automatically created security issues
2. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update base images and Python packages
3. **Document Exceptions**: Add justified exceptions to `.trivyignore` with proper documentation
4. **Test Security Changes**: Use `workflow_dispatch` to trigger manual security scans

### For Security Teams
1. **Regular Reviews**: Review the `.trivyignore` file quarterly
2. **Severity Assessment**: Periodically evaluate if the CRITICAL/HIGH-only policy meets security requirements
3. **Exception Audits**: Validate that security exceptions remain relevant and justified

## Configuration Changes

To modify the severity filtering:

1. **Include MEDIUM severity**: Change `CRITICAL,HIGH` to `CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM` in both workflow files
2. **Include only CRITICAL**: Change `CRITICAL,HIGH` to `CRITICAL` in both workflow files
3. **Disable filtering**: Remove severity restrictions to scan for all levels

**Files to update:**
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker-security-scan.yml`

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Scheduled Scans**: Biweekly for comprehensive security scans, weekly for Docker-specific scans
- **Dependency Updates**: Monitor for new CVEs affecting documented exceptions
- **Policy Reviews**: Annual review of severity filtering policy effectiveness
